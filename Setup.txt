 To be able to use and test the project here is what you do: MAKE SURE YOU DO THESE AND TEST IT BEFORE PUSHING BACK TO GITHUB!

1. Add project
     team>>Git>>clone
     add the clone and place the parent directory on your desktop (or just somewhere you will remember where it is at.

2. Add server:
     services tab>>right click Servers>>add server
     Click Apache Tomcat or TomEE>> Click next
     Click Browse...>> Go to that project folder you saved and click on "apache-tomee-webprofile-1.7.4" then click open for that folder.
     Enter your username and password (does not matter what) and click Finish

3. Add all project libraries
     All of the libraries are in:
     Saved project folder>>majorclassifier>>src>>java>>resources>>Lib
     Also go in and add the library [Spring Framework 3.2.7] and remove the reference for [Spring framework-300] if it exists.
     
4. Resolve the server and database references.
    Resolving the server just click on Tomee or tomcat in the selection screen then hit ok.
    To resolve the database, apache-tomee-webprofile-1.7.4>>lib>>sqljdbc41.jar
    
5.Make a new brnach for your testing
     Click on Team>>Branch/Tag>>Create branch
     Name the branch using your name (I.E.: Cory, Devin, Levi, etc)
     Click Create
     When the pop up comes up, click on Open project.
     
6.Make sure you have no proxy set in options
     Click on Tools>>Options
     In the Proxy Settings on the General tab, make sure "No Proxy" is checked
     Click Apply

7.Hit F6 to start the project will which will automatically start the server for you and have it running in the background.
    It will then open a page on whichever browser you have it set to default to ( I have Chrome with netbeans extension plugin).
    It is a local server so you should be able to test from anywhere, but you will need to be down here in Haivland to be able to test           with the server.
    
8.If there are still reference errors, or any errors that occur. Try [Clean and Build] the project (with tomcat server switched off)
    then restart netbeans. Then everything should be fixed.
	
When you need to commit changes for your branch please only select (ctr + left click) the files that you changed. DO NOT CLICK ON THE PROJECT AND COMMIT THE ENTIRE PROJECT!!
    
When you save a change to the project netbeans will auto restart the server and refresh the tab in your browser so the changes can be seen.

If you use Chrome with netbeans extension, there will be a drop down that will come up telling you debugging is going on. 
  If you close out of that drop down netbeans will lose connection with the tab. You can google like i did on how to get rid of that
  drop down, but keep in mind then that as long as that tab is open netbeans will have a connection to it whether the
  server for the project is up or not. So make sure to close that tab when you are done or resources on your computer will be eaten up.
  I noticed that while debugging with a server up netbeans takes up a whole 1.5 GB of ram just being idol.
  
Also, remember you have to have netbeans 8.xx  or later or else this will not work, and if you want to use Chrome with netbeans
  extension you will have to download the extension.
  
If you wish to make the debugging message from Chrome, then here is the link on how to do so.
