Windows task scheduler will call a batch file that will start a jar file in the dist folder. That jar file will then go up 2 directories and proceed to read each excel file name.
It will be looking specifically at the TTL (Time to live) part of the file name. That part is in the form of a timestamp that says when the file was created, but the program will take
the file and add 7 days to that then compare that timestamp with the current one. If the 2 are within maybe 3-4 hours or so the program will use the email part of the file to 
send an email to the user saying that they have so many hours till the file is deleted. If the 2 timestamps are overlapped, then the file will be deleted.
